## Movie Recommender
This project outlines the concepts involved in building a Complete Recommendation System for recommending Movies to users. The dataset used is the [MovieLens](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khandakernahidmahmud/movie-lens-20m-dataset) data. It has been collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.

## Setup
To run the code on your own machine, rather than using a managed notebook service like Colab, you will need to set up a development environment. ML and DL engineers should have some experience working with development environments, so it is beneficial to gain this skill beforehand.

**To set up the development environment on a local or remote machine, please follow the instructions in the setup folder's README.md file.**
